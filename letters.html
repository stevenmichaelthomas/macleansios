    <b>Single Situation </b>
    <p>It seems somewhat timely, with the debate surrounding Omar Khadr’s age when he was arrested, that you would publish a picture on your “Good News, Bad News” page (Nov. 5) showing a young boy supposedly protesting the killing of Lebanon’s security chief Wissam al-Hassan. Was the 15-year-old Khadr a child warrior or an innocent being led around by adults? The young boy in this picture likely has no idea who Wissam al-Hassan was and even less knowledge of what his position entailed and how it might personally affect him. Any faction will use whatever means are available to garner support for their cause.</p>

    <b>Colonial crimes</b>
    <p>Trying to put the U.K. on trial for alleged anti-Mau Mau atrocities that may have happened over 50 years ago only proves that trawling lawyers never met a scam they didn’t like (“Empire on trial,” International, Oct. 29). Far more worthy of litigation are the three years of deliberate and well-documented RAF firebombing of German civilian cities; the U.S. firebombing of wooden Tokyo, plus Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the U.K. using hellhole concentration camps to wipe out Boer civilians; the Japanese murdering prisoners and civilians; Mao Zedong and his “revolutions”; Vietnam and the Hanoi Hilton; Cuban revolutionaries using murder as policy; Robert Mugabe and the persecution of farmers, etc.; and the entire Muslim hierarchy that permits its practitioners to use Islam as an excuse for the most horrible atrocities. Of all these, the only ones having a ghost of a chance are those select few brought against normally well-behaved Western democracies, proving that justice is not only blind but biased. </p>

    <b>Provincial border battleground </b>
  
    <p>I appreciate the article outlining the difficulty B.C. Premier Christy Clark and Alberta Premier Alison Redford have in negotiating the needs of their constituents and the needs of their governments (“Battle lines,” National, Nov. 5), but your writer focused mostly on B.C.’s perceived objections to tankers off the coast. Most of us living in B.C.’s Interior are far more concerned with the proposed pipeline’s potential to compromise our fresh water supply. The proposed Enbridge pipeline would cross the Stuart River, which is a tributary to the Nechako River, which flows through Prince George into the Fraser River. When a spill occurs, it will have a serious impact on any environment. The drinking water reservoir of B.C.’s Interior is a shallow one, and a spill near the Stuart River will compromise the drinking water for a city of over 80,000 residents. Please don’t simplify the objections of B.C. citizens—it’s about the ocean but it’s also about our day-to-day lives.  </p>
