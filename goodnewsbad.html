            <dd>With the province still reeling from the tragic suicide of bullied teenager Amanda Todd, the RCMP in British Columbia has responded with its own emotional YouTube video. Entitled &ldquo;It Gets Better,&rdquo; the nine-minute clip includes candid interviews with 20 Mounties discussing their experiences growing up gay&mdash;the ridicule, the confusion and the good days that eventually came. &ldquo;I can absolutely tell you,&rdquo; says one officer, &ldquo;that it gets better.&rdquo; Adds another: &ldquo;Things get way better.&rdquo; As public service announcements go, it doesn&rsquo;t get much better. </dd>

            <dd>After a two-year impasse, Ottawa has settled a key trade deal that will allow Canadian firms to sell nuclear technology to India. During his state visit to New Delhi, Stephen Harper announced that long-standing concerns about monitoring India&rsquo;s use of Canadian uranium have been resolved. The feds had every reason to be cautious; in 1976, India used Canadian nuclear materials to test its first nuclear bomb. But any fallout from that dispute is long settled, and Canada now believes India&mdash;desperate for new sources of energy and overseen by the UN&rsquo;s International Atomic Energy Agency&mdash;will act responsibly.</dd>

            <dd>Shoppers Drug Mart faced the music when it decided to shut off the Christmas carols last week. Some Canadians assumed the pharmacy chain had bowed to political correctness and ditched Yuletide hymns altogether. But the truth is completely rational: some customers said it&rsquo;s a tad too early for <em>Jingle Bells</em>, and Shoppers agreed. The really good news? When the seasonal songs do return, the choices could include new offerings from the Backstreet Boys, Cee Lo Green and reunited Grease stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.</dd>

            <dd>A British UFO organization admits that the whole idea of alien spaceships could soon be &ldquo;a dead idea.&rdquo; But Bigfoot? That myth is alive and well&mdash;so much so that a professor at Idaho State University has announced plans to float a homemade blimp over western U.S. mountain ranges in search of the creature. All he needs now is a very big donation ($300,000) to build the dirigible.</dd>
